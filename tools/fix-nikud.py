"""Repair transcription errors in the vocalised text.

Three faults in the Wikisource transcription, each verified against correct
spellings that appear elsewhere in the very same files. Run with --check to
report without writing.

Deliberately NOT touched: the order of dagesh and shin/sin dots relative to
their vowels. The files put the dot first, which is the normal typing order
and what HarfBuzz expects; Unicode canonical order would put it after the
vowel, and normalising to that renders worse in several browsers.
